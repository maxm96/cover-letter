# cover-letter
This is my KSU CIS 598 project. It's a spin on the card game [Love Letter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love_Letter_(card_game)).

There's nothing fancy going on. The backend is a simple Node/Express server. The gameplay is done over a websocket connection using [socket.io](https://socket.io/).

I didn't think it was necessary to use a frontend framework so it is just vanilla JavaScript. It's certainly a bit messier than I would like, but it does the job.
